'ember-headless-table': major

In prepr for supporting Glint 1.0,
ember-headless-table no longer will support TypeScript < 4.8.

Additionally, the support policy is changing from a minimum version, to a [rolling window](https://www.semver-ts.org/#decouple-typescript-support-from-lts-cycles) policy, as described in https://semver-ts.org.

The current and prior two TypeScript versions will be supported, giving a rolling window of 3 TypeScript versions.
