# Lots of data (no virtualization)

This demo is the same as "[Lots of Data](/docs/demos/lots-of-data)",
but without virtualization and no use of [@html-next/vertical-collection][gh-vc]

[gh-vc]: https://github.com/html-next/vertical-collection

In this demo, 6 columns x 40 rows are updating as quickly as requestAnimationFrame allows.
