# Demos and examples

While each plugin has its own demo for how to use the plugin (and in combination with other plugins),
there are common behaviors and patterns that can be acheived with the plugin system (with the existing plugins)
that fit more in to a "kitchen-sink" style collection of demos.

If you have an idea for a demo, please [open an issue](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ember-headless-table/issues)
requesting the demo, or even better, submit a pull request adding your demo.
